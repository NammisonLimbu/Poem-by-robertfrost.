<FONT SIZE="23" COLOR="PINK" FACE="Arial">  Stopping by woods on a snowy evening </P></FONT> <BR>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">-Robert Frost </P>
<FONT SIZE="6" FACE="Elephant"> Whose woods these are I think I know<BR>
His house is in the village though;<BR>
He will not see me stopping here<BR>
To watch his woods fill up with snow<BR>
My little horse must think it queer<BR>
To stop without a farmhouse near<BR>
Between the woods and frozen lake<BR>
The darkest evening of the year<BR>
He gives his harness bells a shake<BR>
To ask if there is some mistake.<BR>
The only other sound's the sweep<BR>
Of easy wind and downy flake.<BR>
The woods are lovely,dark and deep<BR>
But I have promises to keep<BR>
And miles to go before I sleep,<BR>
And miles to go before I sleep. </FONT>
